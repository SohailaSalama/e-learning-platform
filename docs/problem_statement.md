# Problem Statement

## Current Issue:
- Many existing platforms (like Moodle) are either too expensive, overly complex for both students and instructors, or lack customization for specific educational needs.

## Needs:
- **Students** need a platform that is accessible on various devices, particularly mobile, and allows them to easily submit assignments and track grades.
- **Instructors** need tools for course creation, content uploading, assignment management, and providing feedback. The platform should also minimize administrative overhead.
- **Administrators** need to ensure the platform is secure, scalable, and reliable, managing both users and content effectively.
